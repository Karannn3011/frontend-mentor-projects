### Links

- Live Site URL: [Here](https://url-shortening-api-frontendmentor-dun.vercel.app/)
When the site loads for the first time, the first URL you enter may not work instantly. Please wait a few seconds and press "Shorten it!" again as the backend server might take a few seconds to get started.
